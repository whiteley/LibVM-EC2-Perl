=head1 NAME

migrate-ebs-image.pl     Copy an EBS-backed Amazon Image from one region to another

=head1 SYNOPSYS

  % migrate-ebs-image.pl --from us-east-1 --to ap-southeast-1 ami-123456

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script copies an EBS-backed Unix/Linux AMI located in the EC2
region indicated by --from to the region indicated by --to. All
associated volume snapshots, including LVM and RAID volumes, are
migrated as well.

If --from is omitted, then the source region is derived from the
endpoint URL contained in the EC2_URL environment variable. The --to
option is required.

This script will ONLY work with EBS backed Linux images. It does not
work with Windows images due to fundamental limitations of the EC2
API.

=head1 COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS

Options can be abbreviated.  For example, you can use -l for
--list-regions and -b for --block-device-mapping:

      --from         Region in which the AMI is currently located (e.g. "us-east-1")
      --to           Region to which the AMI is to be copied (e.g. "us-west-1") REQUIRED
      --access_key   EC2 access key
      --secret_key   EC2 secret key
      --block-device-mapping 
                     Add additional block devices to the image.
      --endpoint     EC2 URL (defaults to http://ec2.amazonaws.com/)
      --quiet        Quench status messages
      --list-regions List the EC2 regions

The --block-device-mapping (-b) option is used to add ephemeral
storage to the destination image. Amazon's API doesn't describe
ephemeral volumes that are associated with images, and so this
information is not copied from the source to the destination image,
requiring you to add it back manually. The value of the argument is a
block device mapping string in the same format as described for the
command line program ec2-register:

 migrate-ebs-image.pl -f us-east-1 -t ap-southeast-1 \
                      -b /dev/sdy=ephemeral0 \
                      ami-123456

=head1 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

The following environment variables are used if the corresponding
options are not present:

 EC2_ACCESS_KEY     your access key
 EC2_SECRET_KEY     your secret key
 EC2_URL            the desired region endpoint

=head1 INSTALLING THIS SCRIPT

This script is part of the Perl VM::EC2 package. To install from the
command line:

 % perl -MCPAN -e 'install VM::EC2'
 % migrate-ebs-image.pl --from us-east-1 --to ap-southeast-1 ami-123456

=head1 IMPORTANT CAVEATS

This script launches two "m1.small" instances, one each in the source
and destination regions. It also creates transient volumes in both
regions to hold the root volume and all other EBS snapshots associated
with the image. Running it will incur charges for instance run time
and data storage.

In addition, this script will transfer data from one region to another
across the internet, incurring internet data out fees on the source
side, and internet data in fees on the destination side. Volumes that
contain a filesystem, such as ext4 or ntfs, are copied from source to
destination using rsync. Volumes that are part of a RAID or LVM volume
are copied at the block level using gzip and dd via the secure
shell. In general, rsync will be much faster and parsimonious of
network bandwidth than block copying!
